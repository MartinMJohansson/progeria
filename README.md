# Progeria
Analysis of cell painting data of one progeria family.
Proband = P387,
Mother = M388,
Father = F389,
Plate = PB000188.
Cells were treated with Lonafarnib, Baricitinib and combinations of these two compounds.
All subjects were treated with compounds.
Plate contains classical control compounds from two different batches for comparison.

This notebook trains a Logistic Regression model on cells from DMSO treated cells from proband and mother.
Lonafarbin and Baricitinib treated cells from proband are classified accordingly.
